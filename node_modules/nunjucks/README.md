# Nunjucks

Nunjucks is a full featured templating engine for javascript. It is a
direct port of the Python-powered [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
templating engine and aims to be feature-complete with jinja2.

It was born out of frustration with other javascript templating
engines. The most popular ones either are ugly and don't abstract
enough (EJS) or have too different of a syntax (Jade).

The only other project like this is
[jinjs](https://github.com/ravelsoft/node-jinjs), which seems to have
been abandoned. The code is also not Javascript, but Coco, is
difficult to work on, has bugs, and is missing features. Nunjucks
hopes to be a robust, pure javascript, and easily extended port of
jinja2.
