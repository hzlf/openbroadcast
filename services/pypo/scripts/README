This directory contains scripts not directly related to pypo
These mainly are things related to liquidsoap & playout

I added those scripts here to have them at hand for
development and also to update/share them via svn


scripts here:

- ls_run.sh
  wrapper to run liquid soap. makes sure that the "current" playlist is
  filled with silence
  
- ls_script.liq (called by ls_run.sh)
  the main liquidsoap control-script

- ls_cue.liq (included by ls_script.liq)
  contains a custom protocol that registers the cue-in/out values from the playlist script
  
- cue_file.py (called by ls_cue.liq)
  a wrapper that does the actual cutting. 
  it is called with: path_to_file[path] cue_in[ss.ms] cue_out[ss.ms] and does the mp3 cutting (with mp3cut)
  returns a temporary file that can be used by ls (make sure to set "TEMP_DIR" in script)
