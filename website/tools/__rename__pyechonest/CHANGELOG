Rev 8.0.0 to 8.0.1

EchoNestAPIError now reports the HTTP status code of the failed request.

Rev 7.1.1 to 8.0.0

Delete old deprecated playlist functions.
Support new Track attributes 'valence' and 'acousticness'.
No longer return Track attributes as 0 if they don't exist on the track.
Audio attributes can now be None.
No longer always get track analysis details (bars, beats, meta, etc.). You now
need to call Track.get_analysis() to populate those attributes. See track.py for
details. (This makes track.track_from_XXX methods much faster for most uses.)
Handle all 2XX, 4XX, and 5XX response codes from the API.
Fix some examples for Tracks from mp3s. Use 7digital-US as preview catalog.
